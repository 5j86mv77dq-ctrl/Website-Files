I don't know how to code - but I'm working in Visual Studio, committing new updates to my code repository on Github, and publishing a blog that was delayed for years.

AI makes that possible.

## AI Makes that Possible

In a world of AI, there are very few moats to industry - few obstacles that can prevent motivated people from moving things forward.

I'm finally publishing a blog that I've thought about for years. Why? AI certainly helped.

## Where AI Can't Help

By now most of us have heard of slop. AI slop, that is. It's when people use AI to generate videos or graphics or text that is obviously below a certain standard, that, generally speaking, human beings hold themselves to. 

It's caused people to fear that the use of AI in content creation is going to lead to a deluge of low-quality content. 

But where AI really should be used is in the systems and operations that surround human beings creating content. AI can help with gathering bibliographies, summarizing large amounts of research and data, and coming up with plans to help you execute in any production. 

AI can be an exceptional helper when it comes to producing content or developing ideas. But we need to be careful that we don't delegate away the aspects of content creation that make them uniquely human.
